# Introduction

Welcome to the Event Tracker documentation.

## What is Event Tracker?

Event Tracker is a declarative React library designed to simplify the implementation of complex event tracking, allowing developers to focus more on their business logic. It is designed to efficiently manage event tracking in applications of any scale.

```tsx
import { createTracker } from "@offlegacy/event-tracker";

// Creating a tracker instance
const [Track, useTracker] = createTracker({
  DOMEvents: {
    onClick: (params, context) => {
      log("Click event:", params, context);
    },
  },
});

// Usage within an app
function App() {
  return (
    <Track.Provider initialContext={{ userId: "userId-123" }}>
      <Track.Click params={{ buttonId: "event-click" }}>
        <button>Event Click!</button>
      </Track.Click>
    </Track.Provider>
  );
}
```

### Key Features

Event Tracker provides various features prioritizing both developer experience and application performance.

| Feature                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Declarative API with Type Safety | Fully supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), reducing errors during development and increasing productivity through auto-completion.                                     |
| Powerful Data Type Validation    | Ensures data reliability through schema-based validation using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).                                                                                                   |
| Optimized Performance            | Minimizes network requests through batching, debouncing, or throttling, reducing the impact on application performance.                                                                   |
| Guaranteed Execution Order       | Ensures asynchronous events are processed in the intended sequence.                                                                                                                       |
| Analytics Tool Independence      | Flexible integration with any analytics tool (e.g., [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/)), without being tied to any specific provider. |
| Clear Separation of Concerns     | Effectively separates tracking logic from business logic, maximizing code maintainability and scalability.                                                                                |

## Core Concepts

There are several key concepts you need to understand to use Event Tracker effectively.

<Steps>

### Instance (`createTracker`)

The foundational starting point of the library. Use the `createTracker` function to generate a tracker instance (a collection of `Track` components and the `useTracker` hook). Define event tracking by configuring DOM event handlers, impression event handlers, schemas, and more.

Multiple tracker instances can be created according to specific purposes (e.g., separate instances for sending events to Google Analytics and Amplitude).

### Provider (`Track.Provider`)

Implemented using React's Context API. Wrap your application or component tree at the top with `Track.Provider` to provide common tracking data (context) to child components. For example, providing information such as `userId` and `pageName` through context allows utilizing this information during each event tracking.

### Event Components (`Track.Click`, `Track.PageView`, etc.)

Special components provided to track events declaratively. These are available from the first element of the array returned by `createTracker`.

- `Track.Click`: Tracks click events occurring on child elements.
- `Track.Impression`: Tracks when child elements become visible on the screen.
- `Track.PageView`: Tracks page view events upon component mount.

In addition, you can customize or utilize various provided components that respond to different user interactions and lifecycle events. Each component can receive and utilize specific event-related data through the `context` and `params` props.

### Custom Hook (`useTracker`)

Used for more complex or conditional event tracking unrelated directly to component lifecycles or DOM events. The `useTracker` hook lets you access context information from `Track.Provider` and execute defined tracking logic imperatively.
